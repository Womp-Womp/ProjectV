# Project Charisma

**Project Charisma** is a comprehensive, all-in-one creation suite for building deep, narrative-rich, turn-based grand strategy games.

## Vision

To empower creators, writers, and developers to build games in the vein of the *Gihren's Greed* series, without requiring deep programming knowledge.

## Building

To build the project, you will need CMake and a C++ compiler.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running

The executables will be located in the `build/charisma-editor` and `build/charisma-engine` directories.

```bash
./charisma-editor/charisma-editor
./charisma-engine/charisma-engine
```
